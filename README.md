The Todil platform aims to mirror a real-world industry-level framework:

- <b> Frontend</b>: Developed using React.
- <b> Backend</b>: Our RESTful API server was built with Spring Boot and deployed to Amazon EC2.
- <b> Database</b>: We utilized MySQL, which was deployed to Amazon RDS.
- <b> AI Integration</b>: To personalize data and enhance user experience, we incorporated the Open AI API.

This project originated from the challenging question, "What did you gain from your internship?" While the knowledge gained was apparent, specifying a unique ‚Äúgem‚Äù of wisdom was not so straightforward. As a result, Todil was born - a tool designed to track and celebrate the journey of ongoing education.

Thank you for visiting, and we hope Todil aids you in your personal growth journey as it did ours!
